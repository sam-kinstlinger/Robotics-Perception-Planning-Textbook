Preface
This textbook is designed to comprehensively cover the core algorithms and paradigms in robotics, with a focus on machine perception and planning. It is intended for both undergraduate and graduate students seeking a deep, principled understanding of robotics.
The central teaching philosophy of this book is to justify each algorithm from first principles, showing when and why it is optimal. Rather than treating techniques as black boxes, we begin with the foundational goals of robotics and derive each algorithm as a solution to those goals. This derivational approach enables students not only to apply algorithms effectively, but also to understand the specific conditions under which they are optimal. It also empowers them to recognize when an algorithm may be suboptimal due to missing or flawed insights. Once students identify these gaps in justification, they are equipped to address them—potentially leading to improved or novel algorithms. In this way, the book not only teaches existing techniques but also cultivates the analytical mindset necessary to advance the field.
Throughout the text, we support this learning process with concrete examples, intuitive explanations, and visualizations that illuminate key insights and clarify the rationale behind each method. Our goal is to equip students with the tools to analyze, apply, and improve robotics algorithms with confidence and rigor.
If at any point while reading this textbook you cannot recall a term’s definition, please refer to the glossary at the end. To fully benefit from this textbook, it is essential to have the equivalent of one university class in statistics, multivariable calculus, linear algebra, computer programming, and robotics. 

About the Authors
This textbook is a joint effort by four educators and researchers in robotics, machine learning, perception, and planning at the University of Maryland, College Park: Samuel Kinstlinger, Andrew Xu, Sameer Chawla, and Brian Fugh. Each author brings research and industry experience spanning both perception and planning, contributing complementary expertise to the project.
The textbook originated as an internal guide for students joining their research team. Frustrated by the prevalence of black-box explanations—where textbooks often present only the procedural steps of algorithms without conveying the underlying reasoning—the authors set out to create a resource that emphasizes deep, principled understanding. This textbook reflects their commitment to transparent, derivation-driven pedagogy that equips students not only to use robotics algorithms, but to truly understand and improve them.
